GENERAL DESCRIPTION

This is an Tryton module for managing needs to handle incomming
orders that use the TCP/IP Fedicom protocol. This is a standard protocol in the
pharmaceutical business in Spain. The protocol itself is implemented somewhere
else and this module simply handles orders reception, calculates units available
and returns the quantity the customer will receive.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

The most important functionalities of the module are:

- Process Internet orders and return unserved units.
- Update modem incoming orders into our Tryton database to keep in sync our stock.
  This should be executed every minute by the cron job framework of Tryton and
  just before any new Internet order is processed.

SERVER

Available fedicom services in "service" directory.

To run Fedicom client:

  export PYTHONPATH=<path>/trytond
  export TRYTOND_CONFIG=<path>/trytond.conf
  python sale_fedicom/services/fedicom_service.py

LOGS

Default file logs is /tmp/fedicom.log. In case you want to change the path
of the log file, you can define a section in trytond.conf file:

  [fedicom]
  # Fedicom port, where are listening calls
  port = 1234
  # File where the server print the logs
  logconf = /var/log/my-fedicom.log
  # fedicom user to create sales
  user = 1
